# My Personal Dotfiles & Scripts Repository

This repository centralizes personal configuration files (dotfiles) and custom scripts to simplify setup and management across multiple systems. 

## Purpose

- Maintain a single source of truth for shell configurations, editor settings, fonts, and scripts.  
- Simplify system setup and portability.  
- Enable version control for personal environment customizations.  

## Usage
To stow a specific package:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
stow <package-name>
```

To stow all packages at once:
```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
stow */
```
